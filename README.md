#### Week 1:

<!-- - [x] Keynotes:

> 1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** mimics human behavior.

> 2. **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that uses statistical methods and algorithms that are able to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

> 3. **Deep learning (DL)** is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data.

> 4. **AWS SageMaker** -->
